## Pagerank-Algorithm
When search engines like Google display search results, they do so by placing more “important” and higher-quality pages higher in the search results than less important pages.
For that reason, the PageRank algorithm was created by Google’s co-founders (including Larry Page, for whom the algorithm was named). In PageRank’s algorithm, a website is more important if it is linked to by other important websites, and links from less important websites have their links weighted less.
